                  <h6 class="text-primary mb-3">Purpose:</h6>
                  <p>To improve mobility, balance, and coordination through guided walking and reaching exercises.</p>
              
                  <h6 class="text-success mb-3">Instructions for the Assisting Person:</h6>
                  <ol>
                    <li><b>Provide Support:</b> Stand to the side or slightly behind the patient, offering support under their arm or on their back, depending on their balance needs.</li>
                    <li><b>Ensure Safety:</b> Make sure the area is free from obstacles and that there is enough space to walk and maneuver comfortably.</li>
                    <li><b>Encourage Proper Posture:</b> Remind the patient to keep their back straight and look forward rather than down to help with balance.</li>
                    <li><b>Walking Guidance:</b> Walk slowly alongside the patient, adjusting your speed to match theirs. Provide gentle encouragement to maintain a steady pace.</li>
                  </ol>
              
                  <h6 class="text-success mb-3">Instructions for the Patient:</h6>
                  <ol>
                    <li><b>Focus on Each Step:</b> Concentrate on lifting your feet and placing them carefully to maintain balance.</li>
                    <li><b>Reaching for the Object:</b> Once in front of the ball or object, extend your arm slowly and steadily to touch it. Engage your core muscles to help with balance.</li>
                    <li><b>Return to Neutral Position:</b> After touching the object, carefully bring your arm back and prepare for the next step.</li>
                    <li><b>Rest as Needed:</b> Take breaks when necessary, and listen to your body to avoid overexertion.</li>
                  </ol>
